Support Bernie by donating the equivalent of a coffee. Even the smallest amount helps!

Coffee For Bernie is completely unaffiliated with Bernie Sanders or any other candidate.
We consist of a few people who really appreciate the integrity of his grassroots campaign and admire his unwavering dedication to keeping interest groups out of politics.


Our purpose is to provide a simple bit of social commentary on a reoccurring theme of this election that 30% of committed delegates somehow equals a clear cut nominee.
We accept and raise no money. 
All links to "Donate" will lead directly to the Sanders official campaign site (please read and follow their guidelines for donating).


Coffee For Bernie costs us nothing but our time.
We built the site manually using free and open source software libraries (citations in humans.tx).
We are using Git Hub's Pages to host the site for free.
The point here being: there isn't money behind this. Coffee For Bernie is a small show of support for Bernie's everyman mentality, and if we can inspire a single person to toss a few bucks his way, then the time and effort will have been worth it.

Important note: While we support Bernie Sanders, we are for progressive politics and liberal tenets above any one candidate. There is no disparaging content towards opposing campaigns featured on Coffee for Bernie, nor will there be.
